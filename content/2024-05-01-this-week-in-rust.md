## Crate of the Week

This week's crate is [efs](https://codeberg.org/RatCornu/efs), a no-std ext2 filesystem implementation with plans to add other file systems in the future.

Another week completely devoid of suggestions, but llogiq stays hopeful he won't have to dig for next week's crate all by himself.

[Please submit your suggestions and votes for next week][submit_crate]!

## Call for Testing
An important step for RFC implementation is for people to experiment with the
implementation and give feedback, especially before stabilization.  The following
RFCs would benefit from user testing before moving forward:

* *No calls for testing were issued this week.*

If you are a feature implementer and would like your RFC to appear on the above list, add the new `call-for-testing`
label to your RFC along with a comment providing testing instructions and/or guidance on which aspect(s) of the feature
need testing.
