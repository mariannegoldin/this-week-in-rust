## Crate of the Week

This week's crate is [pulso](https://github.com/guapodero/pulso), a simple metrics collector for TCP/IP.

Thanks to [guapodero](https://users.rust-lang.org/t/crate-of-the-week/2704/1312) for the self-suggestion!

[Please submit your suggestions and votes for next week][submit_crate]!

## Call for Testing
An important step for RFC implementation is for people to experiment with the
implementation and give feedback, especially before stabilization.  The following
RFCs would benefit from user testing before moving forward:

### [RFCs](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/issues?q=label%3Acall-for-testing)
* *No calls for testing were issued this week.*

### [Rust](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/labels/call-for-testing)
* *No calls for testing were issued this week.*

### [Rustup](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustup/labels/call-for-testing)
* *No calls for testing were issued this week.*

If you are a feature implementer and would like your RFC to appear on the above list, add the new `call-for-testing`
label to your RFC along with a comment providing testing instructions and/or guidance on which aspect(s) of the feature
need testing.

### Rust Compiler Performance Triage

A relatively quiet week, with few large changes, the largest driven by further
increasing the scope of unsafe precondition checking.

Triage done by **@simulacrum**.
Revision range: [1d0e4afd..a59072ec](https://perf.rust-lang.org/?start=1d0e4afd4cac09078e12a232508c3e9f8d42535d&end=a59072ec4fb6824213df5e9de8cae4812fd4fe97&absolute=false&stat=instructions%3Au)

2 Regressions, 3 Improvements, 5 Mixed; 3 of them in rollups
