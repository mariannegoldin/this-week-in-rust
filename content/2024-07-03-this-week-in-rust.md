## Crate of the Week

This week's crate is [asak](https://github.com/chaosprint/asak), a terminal-based audio recording/playback TUI.

Despite a lamentable lack of suggestions this week, llogiq is reasonably pleased with his choice.

[Please submit your suggestions and votes for next week][submit_crate]!

[submit_crate]: https://users.rust-lang.org/t/crate-of-the-week/2704

## Calls for Testing
An important step for RFC implementation is for people to experiment with the
implementation and give feedback, especially before stabilization.  The following
RFCs would benefit from user testing before moving forward:

### [RFCs](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/issues?q=label%3Acall-for-testing)
* *No calls for testing were issued this week.*

### [Rust](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/labels/call-for-testing)
* *No calls for testing were issued this week.*

### [Rustup](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustup/labels/call-for-testing)
* *No calls for testing were issued this week.*

If you are a feature implementer and would like your RFC to appear on the above list, add the new `call-for-testing`
label to your RFC along with a comment providing testing instructions and/or guidance on which aspect(s) of the feature
need testing.

### Rust Compiler Performance Triage

# 2024-07-02 Triage Log

We saw a large set of primary benchmarks regress, mostly due to PR #120924 (`lint_reasons` and `#[expect]`) and PR #120639 (new effects
desugaring). Separate from those, there are a couple rollup PRs (#127076, #127096) with some regressions that were limited to relatively few benchmarks; pnkfelix was unable to isolate a injecting PR that can be identified as a root cause (outside assistance welcome!).

Triage done by **@pnkfelix**.
Revision range: [c3d7fb39..cf2df68d](https://perf.rust-lang.org/?start=c3d7fb398569407350abe044e786bc7890c90397&end=cf2df68d1f5e56803c97d91e2b1a9f1c9923c533&absolute=false&stat=instructions%3Au)

4 Regressions, 3 Improvements, 11 Mixed; 7 of them in rollups
59 artifact comparisons made in total

[Full report here](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-perf/blob/903bfae931250761eadc291a8fe34c7c52003f82/triage/2024-07-02.md)

### [Approved RFCs](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/commits/master)

Changes to Rust follow the Rust [RFC (request for comments) process](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs#rust-rfcs). These
are the RFCs that were approved for implementation this week:
* [RFC: Unblock Cargo feature metadata](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/3416)
