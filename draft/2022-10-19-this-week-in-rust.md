### Rust Compiler Performance Triage

Overall a fairly busy week, with many improvements and regressions, though the
net result ends up being a small regression. Pretty busy week in terms of
regressions in rollups as well, which unfortunately mostly were not followed up
on prior to the report being put together, despite the relative ease of running
perf against individual PRs now.

Triage done by **@simulacrum**.
Revision range: [1e926f06..e0f8e60](https://perf.rust-lang.org/?start=1e926f06528ecb2503f026e2fd53cb735d487b10&end=e0f8e60dddfecfc9093ee9d9f42557d8260c0355&absolute=false&stat=instructions%3Au)

2 Regressions, 4 Improvements, 4 Mixed; 4 of them in rollups
47 artifact comparisons made in total

See [full report](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-perf/blob/master/triage/2022-10-18.md) for details.

### [Call for Testing](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/issues?q=label%3Acall-for-testing)
An important step for RFC implementation is for people to experiment with the
implementation and give feedback, especially before stabilization.  The following
RFCs would benefit from user testing before moving forward:

* *No RFCs issued a call for testing this week.*

If you are a feature implementer and would like your RFC to appear on the above list, add the new `call-for-testing`
label to your RFC along with a comment providing testing instructions and/or guidance on which aspect(s) of the feature
need testing.

### [Approved RFCs](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/commits/master)

Changes to Rust follow the Rust [RFC (request for comments) process](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs#rust-rfcs). These
are the RFCs that were approved for implementation this week:

* *No RFCs were approved this week.*

### Final Comment Period

Every week, [the team](https://www.rust-lang.org/team.html) announces the 'final comment period' for RFCs and key PRs
which are reaching a decision. Express your opinions now.

#### [RFCs](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/labels/final-comment-period)

* *No RFCs entered Final Comment Period this week.*

#### [Tracking Issues & PRs](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues?q=is%3Aopen+label%3Afinal-comment-period+sort%3Aupdated-desc)

* * *No Tracking Issues or PRs entered Final Comment Period this week.*

### [New and Updated RFCs](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pulls)

* [new] [Add RFC for calling default trait methods](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/3329)
* [new] [Add lang-team advisors team](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/3327)
